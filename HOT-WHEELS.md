# Hot Wheels

notes whtatodo


* [X] pass variables to driver methods
* [ ] better approach to injecting driver since current way feels clumsy. Also, currently driver only works if all 4
arguments are given which is kinda shitty because if i don't need, say parentScopeMock, i still must give at least {}. That's shit
* [ ] should driver be a constructor rather than object literal?
* [X] pass this for driver methods so that other driver methods could be reused
